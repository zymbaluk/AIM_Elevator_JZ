Elevator Control
Instructions

 

Please respond to this exercise with a public git repository (e.g. github or bitbucket) and add that link to this task.
Include readme.md that contains instructions to run your code 
Include code that satisfies the scenario below.


  

Scenario

You are a part of a new development team that is supplying an API (over http) that will be used by multiple dependent teams. It is your task to design the API and implement a minimal set of code that the other teams can use to test their integration. Unblocking those teams by creating the interface is more important than building a complete set of business logic.

 

You are tasked with designing an API for an elevator control system. Your API needs to account for the following scenarios:

* A person requests an elevator be sent to their current floor
* A person requests that they be brought to a floor
* An elevator car requests all floors that it’s current passengers are servicing (e.g. to light up the buttons that show which floors the car is going to)
* An elevator car requests the next floor it needs to service
 

Another developer should be able to clone the git repo and invoke a single command that builds and runs the service. The developer should be able to make requests to localhost:8080 to test the services using a tool such as postman or curl. Be sure to include information about how the services should be called.

 

The code should be developed in the same way that you develop in day-to-day professional work and branched, committed and merged as you would a production service.

 

Evaluation Criteria 

·      Your overall strategy and methodology

·      The quality of your documentation,  

·      The technical correctness and transparency of the service code.  

 

You may have questions about the implementation or use of this API and we encourage you to ask questions or request any clarification by contacting your Manager of Talent Acquisition and Retention (your AIM recruiter) 

 

Thank you, have fun, and good luck.
